<h2>Introduction</h2>
AtliQ Grands, a leading name in India's hospitality scene for 20+ years, runs a prestigious chain of five-star hotels in key cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
AtliQ Grands is confronted with a significant business challenge: declining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels segment due to ineffective decision-making. Compounding the issue is the absence of an in-house data analytics team, leaving them without crucial insights. To address this, the managing director aims to integrate business and data intelligence into their strategies. However, reliance on third-party services for historical data insights highlights the pressing need for a comprehensive solution to enhance revenue management and regain competitive advantage.
