<h2>Introduction</h2>
AtliQ Grands, a leading name in India's hospitality scene for 20+ years, runs a prestigious chain of five-star hotels in key cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore. Offering luxury and business accommodations across Standard, Elite, Premium, and Presidential categories, this analysis explores operational insights to optimize performance.
<br>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
AtliQ Grands is confronted with a significant business challenge: declining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels segment due to ineffective decision-making. Compounding the issue is the absence of an in-house data analytics team, leaving them without crucial insights. To address this, the managing director aims to integrate business and data intelligence into their strategies. However, reliance on third-party services for historical data insights highlights the pressing need for a comprehensive solution to enhance revenue management and regain competitive advantage.

<h2>My Role As Data Analyst</h2>
As a data analyst, my primary business objective is to evaluate the overall performance of AtliQ Grands' hotels, integrating key metrics such as revenue growth trends, room optimization, and booking analysis. By harnessing data intelligence, I aim to provide a holistic understanding of the hotels' performance, including their overall rating. This analysis will enable me to offer insightful recommendations aimed at enhancing efficiency, maximizing revenue, and improving customer satisfaction for sustained business growth.
